🟢 Blinkit-Sales  Data Analysis using Python and SQL
📘 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Blinkit’s sales and product data to understand which outlets and items perform the best.
I used Python for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization, and used SQL to achieve the same analysis through queries.
The goal was to find meaningful business insights from the data and compare how both tools help in analysis.

🎯 Objective

The main objective of this project was to clean and analyze Blinkit’s dataset to find patterns and trends in sales, item visibility, and outlet performance.
I used Python to visualize the data and SQL to cross-check the same results with queries.

🧠 Key Findings

Supermarket Type 1 outlets had the highest average sales.

Items with higher visibility usually had lower average sales.

Low-fat items sold better than regular ones.

Outlets established between 2012–2014 showed steady performance growth.

🧰 Tools and Technologies

Python (Jupyter Notebook) → for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization

SQL → for data querying and analytical validation

Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

Database: SQL.

🔍 Steps I Followed

Data Cleaning in Python

Removed missing values and duplicates

Standardized column names

Checked data types and corrected inconsistencies

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Used bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to visualize trends

Compared sales by outlet type, item fat content, and visibility

SQL Analysis

Wrote SQL queries to calculate average sales by outlet type and item category

Used aggregate functions like AVG(), SUM(), and GROUP BY

Verified that SQL and Python results matched

Result Comparison

The same insights were visible in both Python and SQL outputs

Helped validate that both tools give consistent analytical results

📈 Results and Insights

Python helped with data visualization and easy exploration.

SQL helped with structured data querying and faster numeric analysis.

Using both tools together gave a better understanding of how data analysis works in different environments.

🚀 How to Run

Download or clone the project folder from GitHub.

Open the blinkit_analysis.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

Run the Python cells for cleaning and visualization.

Run the SQL queries inside the notebook (or directly in SQL Workbench).

🧮 What’s Inside the Notebook

The notebook has two main parts:

Python Section: Cleaning data, creating graphs, and finding trends.

SQL Section: Writing queries to find the same results using SQL commands.
